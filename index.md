# INTRODUCTION

Human voice is a complex signal since it is made of many small and random variations produced by air passing through the vocal folds. As a result, it could be challenging to make it sound natural. I am interested in how natural singing voice can be simulated, so this project is an exploration of singing voice synthesis. With the sound synthesis techniques I have learned in MUMT307, I built a Max Patcher generating human singing vowels.

# Design & Method

The two most important elements for our model are the sound source and the filters
## Sound Source
Belánger, Traube and Piché[1] proposed that
## Filters
To synthesize vowels, we need to model the source and 
we need to identify the formants. A formants
